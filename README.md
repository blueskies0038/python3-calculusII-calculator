# Background
After completing my Advanced Placement Calculus BC course, I made this simple calculator without using the math module to help me review for the upcoming AP Test. The calculator utilizes limits and infinite series to approximate values such as definite integrals, trigonometry functions, derivatives, etc. After researching the various methods to approximate values such as pi and e^x, I used what I believed would be the most efficient ones: the Nilakantha method and the Brothers formula, respectively. The functions sin(x) and cos(x) were approximated by using Taylor's series while the arctan(x) function was approximated using a power series. After programming these 3 functions, they were used as a foundation to build the other trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions. To add some graphing calculator elements, I decided to not only include derivatives of a function at a certain point and definite integrals, but I also included roots. Using the classic Newton method, the program is able to estimate the roots of a function by using guesses, just like a graphing calculator does.

# Outro
For any high schoolers, this is a really fun and easy way to review for upcoming tests - especially about series. I encourage you to make an even better calculator, one that is even more accurate or even more efficient.
